Grab a set of light dumbbells and hold them straight out to the sides with palms facing towards the ceiling so your body makes the shape of a t. bend your elbows slightly in. Since each muscle isn�t doing a lot of work, then following a workout like this would be okay. Slightly bend over at waist, keeping back arch neutral, don’t.
